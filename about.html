                Excellent! Very good service from beginning to end. Even with a
                COVID-related delay in the middle of it, our guide stayed in contact
                with us and got us a reschedule with the utmost of ease. Thank you!
                I had to change my booking due to covid and I know your team was under the pump but I was always reassured and knew my booking was being looked after. We will definitely book other holidays through travel online.

                I usually plan and book our holidays myself and was a little cautious but thought I'd give booking with TravelOnline a go. Booking with TravelOnline was easy and trouble free. My consultant and other staff were very helpful and friendly. Documentation etc. was received promptly and the emails received prior to our trip were very helpful, ensuring we had everything in order before our departure. When planning our next trip I will certainly look at what is available and I would have no hesitation in recommending TravelOnline to family or friends.

                Good value package but quite excruciating to book.Also really
                disappointed that nobody notified us of the change in
                requirements for PCR from 72 to 48 hours on 01/01/22. Luckily I
                double checked this myself prior to paying $150 for the PCR.
                Deals always tend to be hard to beat on travel online. We've booked with them for years for this reason. On this occasion, it took a long while (many days) on a few occasions for travel online to return phone calls, we had to chase them up, and some minor details were incorrect on itineraries received (we had to make an adjustments which lengthened the process). Overall I would book again and recommend on the basis the deals are hard to pass up.

                The trip package and inclusions were a great deal and value for money and it meant we didn't have much to worry about organising. Lisa and team were a pleasure to deal with and they replied promptly with our questions and kept us informed of any changes. Will deffinately use again!
